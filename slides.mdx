# EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

<BGImage src={'./assets/images/aws-ec2.png'} />

---

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Is a Webservice that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes.
- Allowing you to quickly scale capacity.
- Both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

---

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Changes the economics of computing by allowing you yo pay only for capacity that you actually use.
- Provides developers the tools to build failure resilient Applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

---

## EC2 - Options

---

### EC2 - On Demand

- Allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

---

### EC2 - Reserved

- provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for a instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.

---

### EC2 - Spot

- enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.

---

### EC2 - Dedicated Hosts

- Physical EC2 server dedicated for you use, Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

---

### On Demand

- Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 whithout any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot interrupted.
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

---

### Reserved

- Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
- Applications that require reserved capacity.
- Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

---

### Spot

- Applications that have flexible start and end times.
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
- Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

---

### Dedicated Hosts

- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
- Can be purchased on-demand (hourly.)
- Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.

---

### EBS Elastic Block Store

- create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances
  you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

---

### Security Group

Security Group is a Virtual Firewall It's controlling traffic to your instances An instance can have multiple security groups.

---

### Inbound

Traffic Ingress

---

### Outbound

Traffic Egress

---

### Security Group Lab

- All Inbound Traffic is Blocked By Default.
- All Outbound Traffic is Allowed.
- Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
- You can have any number EC2 Instances within a security group.

---

### Security Group Lab

- you can have multiple security group groups attached EC2 Instances.
- Security Groups are STATEFUL.
  - if you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is allowed back out again.
- you cannot block specific ip addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists.
- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

---

## EFS - Elastic File System

---

### EFS - Elastic File System

- Is a file storage service for Amazon EC2 Instances.
- Is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you create and configure file systems quickly and easily.
- Storage Capacity is Elastic, growing ans shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

---

### EFS Features

- Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
- You only pay for the storage you use (non pre-provisioning required)
- Can scale up to the petabytes.
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
- Data is stored across multiple AZ’s within a region
- Read After Write Consistency.

---

## ELB - Elastic Load Balancer

---

### ELB - Elastic Load Balancer

Elastic Load Balancer to load balance the traffic these instances

<BGImage src={'./assets/images/load-balancer.png'} />

---

### ELB - Elastic Load Balancer

- Instances monitored by ELB are reported as: InService, or OutService
- Health Checks: check the instance by talking to it.
- Have their own DNS name. you are never given an ip address.
- Read the ELB FAQ for Classic Load Balancers

## AWS IAM - Identity Access Management

---

### Identity Access Management

- Allows you yo manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.
- IAM does not require region election

---

### What does IAM give you

- Centralised control of your AWS account
- Shared Access to your AWS account
- Granular permission
- Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, Linkedin)
- Multi-factor Authentication
- Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
- Integrates with many different AWS services

---

### What does IAM give you

- Support PCI DSS Compliance
- IAM consists of the following:
  - Users
  - Groups (A way to group our users and apply polices to them collectively)
  - Roles
  - Policy Documents
- IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time
- The root account is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access by default

---

### What does IAM give you

- New Users have NO permissions when first created
- New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
- These are not the same as a password, and you cannot use the Access KeyID & Secret Access Key to Login in to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line however
- You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So save them in a secure location.
- Always setup Multi-factor Authentication on yur root account 19 You can create and customise your own password rotation policies

---

### IAM Best practices

- Enables you to control who can do what in your AWS account
- Users, groups, roles and permissions
- Control - Centralized - Fine-grained - APIs, resources, and AWS console Security - Secure by default - Multiple users, individual security credentials and permissions

---

## AWS route53 & DNS

---

### What is DNS?

If you’ve used the internet, you’ve used DNS.
DNS is used to converto human friendly domain names (such as https://equipindustry.com) into an Internet Protocol (IP)
address (such as http://82.123.145.200)

IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the network.
IP addresses commonly come in 2 different forms, IPv4 and IPv6.

---

### Domain Registrars

- Because all of the names in a given domain name have to be unique there needs to be a way to organize this all so that domain names aren’t duplicated.
- This is where domain registrar come in.
- A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains.

---

### SOA Records

The SOA record stores information about;

- The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone.
- The administrator of the zone.
- The current version of the data file.

---

### SOA Records

- The number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates.
- The number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer.
- The maximum number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must either be refreshed or expire.
- the default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.

---

### NS Records

NS Stands for name Server records and are used by Top Level Domain servers
to direct traffic to the Content DNS server Which contains the Authoritative DNS Records.

---

### A Records

The record is used by a computer to translate the name of domain to the ip address.

For example: http://equipindustry might point to http://123.10.10.90

---

### TTL

The Length that a DNS record is cached on either the resolving servers “Time to Live” (TTL) in seconds.

---

### CNAMES

A Canonical Name (CName) can be used to resolve one domain one other.

For Example:
You may have a mobile website with the domain http://m.equipindustry.com that is used for when users browse to your domain name on their mobile devices.

You may also want the name http://mobile.equipindustry.com to resolve to this same address.

---

### Alias Records

Alias are used to map resource record sets in you hosted zone to elastic load balancers, CloudFront Distributions, or S3 Buckets that are as websites.

---

## AWS S3

- S3 Is a safe place to store your files.
- It is Object based storage.
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

---

### The Basics

- S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload files
- Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Bucket(Folder)
- S3 is a universal namespace, that is, name must be unique globally
- When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful

---

### The Basics

- Built for 99.9% availability for the S3 platform
- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availabilityAmazon guarantees 99.99999999% durability for S3 information (11 \* 9's)
