### EBS Elastic Block Store

-  create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances
you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.
