- The root account is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access by default

### What does IAM give you

- New Users have NO permissions when first created
- New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
- These are not the same as a password, and you cannot use the Access KeyID & Secret Access Key to Login in to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line however
- You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So save them in a secure location.
- Always setup Multi-factor Authentication on yur root account 19 You can create and customise your own password rotation policies
